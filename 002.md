# User can take a dust borrow from his own position to make sure they get back their liquidation bonus

## Summary
User can take a dust borrow from his own position to make sure they get back their liquidation bonus

## Vulnerability Detail
The way liquidations work within Wagmi is that once a borrowing becomes liquidateable, every lender of said position has to manually liquidate it in order to receive their funds back. 

When creating a position, the user has to send some extra funds marked as liquidation bonus - which the user will get back if othe order is closed without a liquidation. However, if they get liquidated, they'll lose said funds.

```solidity
            if (completeRepayment) {
                LoanInfo[] memory empty;
                _removeKeysAndClearStorage(borrowing.borrower, params.borrowingKey, empty);
                feesAmt =
                    _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, currentFees) /
                    Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION +
                    liquidationBonus;
```

The problem is that the liquidation bonus is only paid out to the last lender to liquidate the user. 

This allows the user to easily bypass this liquidation bonus limitation by simply creating a small dust position within said Univ3 pool and borrowing from this same univ3 position.

Then, if the user becomes liquidateable, they'll just make sure to liquidate themselves last and get back their liquidation bonus.
