# Borrow repayments will fail if user has to sell part of its hold token

## Summary
Borrow repayments will fail if user has to sell part of its hold token

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the way `_restoreLiquidity` works. 
```solidity
                    // Calculate the square root price using `_getCurrentSqrtPriceX96` function
                    uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = _getCurrentSqrtPriceX96(
                        params.zeroForSaleToken,
                        cache.saleToken,
                        cache.holdToken,
                        cache.fee
                    );

                    (amounts.amount0, amounts.amount1) = AmountsLiquidity
                        .getAmountsRoundingUpForLiquidity(
                            sqrtPriceX96,
                            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(cache.tickLower),
                            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(cache.tickUpper),
                            loan.liquidity
                        );
``` 
As it can be seen, it fetches the current uniswap price and based on it calculates such `amounts.amount0, amounts.amount1` that they should amount for `loan.liquidity` in the current pool state. 

However, there occurs a problem when the vault doesn't have enough `saleToken`  to give as a flashloan and the user does not wish to flashloan from univ3/ aave.

```solidity
        if (saleTokenBalance < saleTokenAmt) {
            // When there are no more routes left or the sender is the flash loan aggregator
            if (
                decodedData.routes.flashLoanParams.length == 0 ||
                msg.sender == flashLoanAggregatorAddress
            ) {
                // Compute the pool address using provided tokens and fee
                address pool = computePoolAddress(
                    decodedData.holdToken,
                    decodedData.saleToken,
                    decodedData.fee
                );
                // Calculate the amount needed for swapping hold tokens to sale tokens
                uint256 holdTokenAmountIn = _calculateAmountsToSwap(
                    !decodedData.zeroForSaleToken,
                    pool,
                    decodedData.loan.liquidity,
                    decodedData.tickLower,
                    decodedData.tickUpper,
                    saleTokenBalance,
                    decodedData.holdTokenDebt,
                    decodedData.amounts
                );
                // Perform the actual Uniswap V3 swap
                saleTokenBalance += _v3SwapExact(
                    v3SwapExactParams({
                        isExactInput: true,
                        fee: decodedData.fee,
                        tokenIn: decodedData.holdToken,
                        tokenOut: decodedData.saleToken,
                        amount: holdTokenAmountIn
                    })
                );
```

In such case, the contract decides to do a univ3 swap. The problem is that it makes that swap on that same pool we've stored in cache. This would lead to a price movement, which means calling `_increaseLiquidity` with the same cached values of `amounts.amount0, amounts.amount1` will result in less liquidity added (and not utilizing the entirety of the two amounts, since the pool's state has changed) 

Since less liquidity has been added, the transaction will revert due to the following: 
```solidity
        // Check if the restored liquidity is less than the loan liquidity amount
        // If true, revert with InvalidRestoredLiquidity exception
        if (restoredLiquidity < loan.liquidity) {
            revert InvalidRestoredLiquidity(loan.tokenId, loan.liquidity, restoredLiquidity);
        }
```

## Recommendation
Instead of making that swap within the same univ3 pool, allow for external swaps here.
