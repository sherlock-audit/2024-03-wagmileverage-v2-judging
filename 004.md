# Attacker can drain the contract of certain token if it is not yet deployed.

## Summary
Attacker can drain the contract of certain token if it is not yet deployed.

## Vulnerability Detail
In certain scenarios, a token's address is known before its deployment (e.g. due to create2 or it already existing at same address on other chain) 

This combined with the fact that the used `safeTrasferFrom` does not check for contract code length can result in future drain of said token. 

```solidity
    function safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transferFrom.selector, from, to, value)
        );
        require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "W-STF");
    }
```

1. User knows address for future token X
2. User creates UniV3 pair X/WETH
3. User creates a single-sided LP position at a certain tick, adding a dust amount of WETH 
4. User creates a borrow on Wagmi with X as hold token and WETH as sale token based on his own univ3 position
5. User uses external swap to swap WETH -> external swaps do not verify any of the data passed, only the function selector and the target contract. Meaning that the user can just do a WETH -> USDC swap here on Uniswap and there would be no problem 
6. The user will then have to pay `amountToPay` of X to the Vault. Since the `safeTransferFrom`  does not check for code length, this will pass. 
7. The user can then call `increaseCollateralBalance` with as much as they'd like. `_pay` will not revert for same reason as above
8. As soon as the token gets deployed and the vault gets some actual tokens X in, the user will be able to call `repay` and steal them
