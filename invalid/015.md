# Arbitrary transferFrom

## Summary

Calling transferFrom functionality with a parameterized from value may lead to theft or loss of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC-20 standard interface specifies a transferFrom() function, which can be used to transfer tokens between two specified accounts. In some implementations, the from address may be vulnerable to attacks that allow anyone to spend another user's token balance.

As a result, a best practice is to ensure that the from address in a call to transferFrom() is the msg.sender value, particularly when calling an ERC-20 implementation that you did not author.

## Impact

lost of funds for users

```solidity
   function _pay(address token, address payer, address recipient, uint256 value) internal {
        if (value > 0) {
            if (payer == address(this)) {
                token.safeTransfer(recipient, value);
            } else {
                token.safeTransferFrom(payer, recipient, value); /// Arbitrary transferFrom
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation

Add 'require payer == msg.sender'
