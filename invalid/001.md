# Any user can close a liquidatable borrow and take all profits

## Summary
Any user can close a liquidatable borrow and take all profits

## Vulnerability Detail
`repay` can be called with 2 different flows - the sender has to set the `params.isEmergency` flag to true if they wish to liquidate and to false if they want to simply close their position and take profits.

When `isEmergency == true`, there's the necessary check that the account is in fact liquidateable 
```solidity
        if (params.isEmergency) {
            (!underLiquidation).revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.FORBIDDEN);
            // rest of the code 
``` 

However, when `isEmergency == false`, there's no check to enforce that the account is in fact not liquidateable. 
```solidity
        } else {
            // Calculate platform fees and adjust fees owed
            currentFees = _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, currentFees);
            // Deduct borrowedAmount from totalBorrowed
            unchecked {
                holdTokenRateInfo.totalBorrowed -= borrowing.borrowedAmount;
            }

            // Transfer the borrowed amount and liquidation bonus from the VAULT to this contract
            Vault(VAULT_ADDRESS).transferToken(
                borrowing.holdToken,
                address(this),
                borrowing.borrowedAmount + liquidationBonus
            );

            // Restore liquidity using the borrowed amount and pay a daily rate fee
            LoanInfo[] memory loans = loansInfo[params.borrowingKey];

            _maxApproveIfNecessary(borrowing.holdToken, address(underlyingPositionManager));
            _maxApproveIfNecessary(borrowing.saleToken, address(underlyingPositionManager));

            _restoreLiquidity(
                RestoreLiquidityParams({
                    zeroForSaleToken: zeroForSaleToken,
                    totalfeesOwed: currentFees,
                    totalBorrowedAmount: borrowing.borrowedAmount,
                    routes: params.routes,
                    loans: loans
                })
            );

            // Remove borrowing key from related data structures
            _removeKeysAndClearStorage(borrowing.borrower, params.borrowingKey, loans);

            // Get the remaining balance of saleToken and holdToken
            (saleTokenOut, holdTokenOut) = _getPairBalance(
                borrowing.saleToken,
                borrowing.holdToken
            );

            (holdTokenOut < params.minHoldTokenOut || saleTokenOut < params.minSaleTokenOut)
                .revertError(ErrLib.ErrorCode.PRICE_SLIPPAGE_CHECK);

            // Pay a profit to a msg.sender
            _pay(borrowing.holdToken, address(this), msg.sender, holdTokenOut);
            _pay(borrowing.saleToken, address(this), msg.sender, saleTokenOut);

            emit Repay(borrowing.borrower, msg.sender, params.borrowingKey);
        }
``` 
This allows for a very tricky situation - when the user is liquidateable (collateral < 0), any user (not even needed to be a lender) can call `repay` and simply set `isEmergency = false`. In this case, the call will repay to all lenders and will then take the profit and send it to the sender of the call

```solidity
            // Pay a profit to a msg.sender
            _pay(borrowing.holdToken, address(this), msg.sender, holdTokenOut);
            _pay(borrowing.saleToken, address(this), msg.sender, saleTokenOut);
```

This could also be utilized by the borrower himself - after becoming liquidateable, they can simply not increase their collateral, avoid paying fees for some time and then close their borrow by calling `repay` with `isEmergency = false`

## Impact
Borrower can avoid paying fees. 
Adversary can steal trade profits and force-close a borrow

check in the else-statement that `underLiquidation == false`
