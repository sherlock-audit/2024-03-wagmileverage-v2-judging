# When the amout of token acquired by a flash loan exceeds the expected value, the callback function will fail.

## Summary

When the amout of token acquired by a flash loan exceeds the expected value, the callback function will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `wagmiLeverageFlashCallback` is used to handle the repayment operation after flash loan. After obtaining enough saleToken, it uses `_v3SwapExact` to convert the saleToken into holdToken. We know that the amount of holdTokens (`holdTokenAmtIn`) is proportional to the amount of saleTokens (`amountToPay`) obtained from flash loans. Later, the function will check the holdTokenAmtIn is no large than decodedData.holdTokenDebt. 

```solidity
// Swap tokens to repay the flash loan
uint256 holdTokenAmtIn = _v3SwapExact(
    v3SwapExactParams({
        isExactInput: false,
        fee: decodedData.fee,
        tokenIn: decodedData.holdToken,
        tokenOut: decodedData.saleToken,
        amount: amountToPay
    })
);
decodedData.holdTokenDebt -= decodedData.zeroForSaleToken
    ? decodedData.amounts.amount1
    : decodedData.amounts.amount0;

// Check for strict route adherence, revert the transaction if conditions are not met
(decodedData.routes.strict && holdTokenAmtIn > decodedData.holdTokenDebt).revertError(
    ErrLib.ErrorCode.SWAP_AFTER_FLASH_LOAN_FAILED
);
```

In the function `_excuteCallback`, the amount of token finally obtained by the user through flash loan is `flashBalance`, which is the balance of the contract.

```solidity
// Transfer the flashBalance to the recipient
decodedData.saleToken.safeTransfer(decodedDataExt.recipient, flashBalance);
// Invoke the WagmiLeverage callback function with updated parameters
IWagmiLeverageFlashCallback(decodedDataExt.recipient).wagmiLeverageFlashCallback(
    flashBalance,
    interest,
    decodedDataExt.originData
);
```

Now let me describe how the attacker compromises the flash loans. 

First, the attacker makes a donation to the `FlashLoanAggregator` contract before the victim performs a flash loan (using front-run). Then victim performs a flash loan, and he/she will get much more flashBalance than expected. Finally, in the function `wagmiLeverageFlashCallback`, the holdTokenAmtIn is larger than experted, which leads to fail.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the function `_excuteCallback`, the amount of token finally obtained by the user through flash loan should be the the balance difference during the flash loan period.
