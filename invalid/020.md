# Insufficient `dailyRateCollateralBalance` Check May Lead to Liquidation Failure when `params.isEmergency`

# Insufficient `dailyRateCollateralBalance` Check May Lead to Liquidation Failure

## Summary
During liquidation under the `params.isEmergency` condition, the system does not verify the availability of sufficient `dailyRateCollateralBalance` to cover the `feesAmt`. This oversight could result in a failure to process the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the context of emergency liquidation, the code adjusts the borrower's outstanding amount and daily rate collateral balance by reducing them by `removedAmt` and `feesAmt` respectively. The `feesAmt` is then recalculated based on the platform's fee picking mechanism, divided by a constant precision value for collateral balance. However, there's a glaring omission: the code lacks a fail-safe for scenarios where the `dailyRateCollateralBalance` is insufficient to cover the `feesAmt`. This gap in the logic can lead to an overflow issue, subsequently triggering a revert and potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Impact
It may result in DoS when liquidation. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L580
```javascript
borrowing.borrowedAmount -= removedAmt;
borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance -= feesAmt;
feesAmt =
    _pickUpPlatformFees(borrowing.holdToken, feesAmt) /
    Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
// Deduct the removed amount from totalBorrowed
```

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to implement a mechanism that proportionally allocates the `feesAmt` according to the available `dailyRateCollateralBalance`. This approach will prevent the overflow issue by ensuring that fee deductions do not exceed the collateral balance, thereby mitigating the risk of a DoS scenario during liquidation.
