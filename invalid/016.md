# [High] Lack of guarantee that the fee of flash loan will be paid by borrower, it may result in DoS when liquidation.

## Summary
When liquidating, we need to make flash loan to pay liquidity first, then we swap holdtoken to saleToken. But code didn't guarantee that the fee of flash loan will be paid. It will be possible that when we swap all holdtoken, we can't have enough saleToken to repay flashloan because it has fee.
