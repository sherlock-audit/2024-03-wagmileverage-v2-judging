# User can bypass giving excess slippage to the protocol by setting themselves as the recipient from the external swap

## Summary
User can bypass giving excess slippage to the protocol by setting themselves as the recipient from the external swap

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the contract, upon taking up a borrow, the user chooses a hold token and sale token. Upon withdrawing both from the Univ3 position, the user has to convert all into hold token. The contract calculates a  `cache.borrowedAmount` - the equivalent value of both tokens combined into simply the hold token. 

If the user swaps the sell tokens and then has a balance of less than `cache.borrowedAmount`, they have to pay the difference
```solidity
  unchecked {
                marginDeposit = cache.borrowedAmount - cache.holdTokenBalance;
            }
``` 
However, if there's positive slippage, ideally it is sent to the protocol's reserves.
```solidity
        // positive slippage
        if (cache.holdTokenBalance > cache.borrowedAmount) {
            // Thus, we stimulate the platform to look for the best conditions for swapping on external aggregators.
            platformsFeesInfo[params.holdToken] +=
                (cache.holdTokenBalance - cache.borrowedAmount) *
                Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
```

The problem is that if the user uses an external swap instead of `_v3SwapExact`, they can input arbitrary data within it, including the recipient address. 

```solidity
        if (params.externalSwap.length != 0) {
            // Call the external swap function
            _callExternalSwap(params.saleToken, params.externalSwap);
        }
```

This would allow them to put their wallet as receiver address, meaning that if there's any positive slippage, the users will keep it to themselves, instead of giving it to the protocol 


## Impact
loss of funds for the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove the external swap or make sure the receiver is this address.
