## Summary
Liquidation bonus scales exponentially instead of linearly. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the code of `getLiquidationBonus` 
```solidity
    function getLiquidationBonus(
        address token,
        uint256 borrowedAmount,
        uint256 times
    ) public view returns (uint256 liquidationBonus) {
        // Retrieve liquidation bonus for the given token
        Liquidation memory liq = liquidationBonusForToken[token];
        unchecked {
            if (liq.bonusBP == 0) {
                // If there is no specific bonus for the token
                // Use default bonus
                liq.minBonusAmount = Constants.MINIMUM_AMOUNT;
                liq.bonusBP = dafaultLiquidationBonusBP;
            }
            liquidationBonus = (borrowedAmount * liq.bonusBP) / Constants.BP;

            if (liquidationBonus < liq.minBonusAmount) {
                liquidationBonus = liq.minBonusAmount;
            }
            liquidationBonus *= (times > 0 ? times : 1);
        }
    }
```
As we can see, the liquidation bonus is based on the entire `borrowAmount`  and multiplied by the number of new loans added.
The problem is that it is unfair when the user makes a borrow against multiple lenders.

If a user takes a borrow for X against 1 lender, they'll have to pay a liquidation bonus of Y.
However, if they take a borrow for 3X against 3 lenders, they'll have to pay 9Y, meaning that taking a borrow against N lenders leads to overpaying liquidation bonus by N times. 

Furthermore, if the user simply does it in multiple transactions, they can avoid these extra fees (as they can simply call `borrow` for X 3 times and pay 3Y in Liquidation bonuses)

make liquidation bonus simply a % of totalBorrowed

We discussed as a team multiplying the bonus depending on the method of taking out a loan and ultimately decided to abandon it completely.
a few days ago I made the corresponding commit https://github.com/RealWagmi/wagmi-leverage/commit/7575ab6659e99e59f5b7b7d1454649091c0295c6

The liquidation bonus was charged more than initially expected, so the userâ€™s cunning could only lead to a fair payment. But ultimately the bonus would still be returned to the trader. The trader paid a more liquidation bonus if he extracted more than one  NFT position, which in itself is a rare case... anyway, we removed it from the code..

Fix looks good, liquidation bonus is now correctly proportional to borrow amount, no matter the number of lenders.

# Issue M-2: When the amout of token acquired by a flash loan exceeds the expected value, the callback function will fail.

## Summary

When the amout of token acquired by a flash loan exceeds the expected value, the callback function will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `wagmiLeverageFlashCallback` is used to handle the repayment operation after flash loan. After obtaining enough saleToken, it uses `_v3SwapExact` to convert the saleToken into holdToken. We know that the amount of holdTokens (`holdTokenAmtIn`) is proportional to the amount of saleTokens (`amountToPay`) obtained from flash loans. Later, the function will check the holdTokenAmtIn is no large than decodedData.holdTokenDebt. 

```solidity
// Swap tokens to repay the flash loan
uint256 holdTokenAmtIn = _v3SwapExact(
    v3SwapExactParams({
        isExactInput: false,
        fee: decodedData.fee,
        tokenIn: decodedData.holdToken,
        tokenOut: decodedData.saleToken,
        amount: amountToPay
    })
);
decodedData.holdTokenDebt -= decodedData.zeroForSaleToken
    ? decodedData.amounts.amount1
    : decodedData.amounts.amount0;

// Check for strict route adherence, revert the transaction if conditions are not met
(decodedData.routes.strict && holdTokenAmtIn > decodedData.holdTokenDebt).revertError(
    ErrLib.ErrorCode.SWAP_AFTER_FLASH_LOAN_FAILED
);
```

In the function `_excuteCallback`, the amount of token finally obtained by the user through flash loan is `flashBalance`, which is the balance of the contract.

```solidity
// Transfer the flashBalance to the recipient
decodedData.saleToken.safeTransfer(decodedDataExt.recipient, flashBalance);
// Invoke the WagmiLeverage callback function with updated parameters
IWagmiLeverageFlashCallback(decodedDataExt.recipient).wagmiLeverageFlashCallback(
    flashBalance,
    interest,
    decodedDataExt.originData
);
```

Now let me describe how the attacker compromises the flash loans. 

First, the attacker makes a donation to the `FlashLoanAggregator` contract before the victim performs a flash loan (using front-run). Then victim performs a flash loan, and he/she will get much more flashBalance than expected. Finally, in the function `wagmiLeverageFlashCallback`, the holdTokenAmtIn is larger than experted, which leads to fail.

## Recommendation

In the function `_excuteCallback`, the amount of token finally obtained by the user through flash loan should be the the balance difference during the flash loan period.

**WangSecurity**

seems to be working as expected since all these parameters are user supplied (I mean decodedData.routes.strict)

The protocol team fixed this issue in PR/commit https://github.com/RealWagmi/wagmi-leverage/commit/37b0268ec936d63beee873dd61b096b47cd673c1.

**WangSecurity**

After additional discussions, we decided to make this a valid medium, cause it's a valid attack vector, but takes a lot of funding and additional external factors

**spacegliderrrr**

Fix looks good, in case aggregator has extra funds, callback will not have to repay for them.
