# Emergency repayments use stale fee values in their calculation


## Proof of Concept

Take a look at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2/blob/169e587af8e9dcff9dd351443e1f64933e762e1d/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L514-L658

Most especially https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2/blob/169e587af8e9dcff9dd351443e1f64933e762e1d/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L552-L562

```solidity

            // Calculate liquidation bonus and adjust fees owed
            if (collateralBalance > 0) {
                unchecked {
                    liquidationBonus +=
                        uint256(collateralBalance) /
                        Constants.COLLATERAL_BALANCE_PRECISION;
                }
            } else {
                currentFees = borrowing.dailyRateCollateralBalance;
            }
```

One can see that, the execution erroneously does not adjust the fees whenever the `collateralBalance > 0`, keep in mind that, note that it's possible that borrower is trying to repay a long time after they've borrowed, i.e now the fees have accrued and should be adjusted.

Now where as the fee later on gets accrued here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2/blob/169e587af8e9dcff9dd351443e1f64933e762e1d/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L610

In some cases it wouldn't be accrued cause, all emergency withdrawals use the unadjusted fee https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-wagmileverage-v2/blob/169e587af8e9dcff9dd351443e1f64933e762e1d/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L565-L608

## Impact

All instances of emergency repayment would lead to a leak of value for protocol since the fees are not adjusted into what's been used in the calculations.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

After increasing the liquidation bonus, the fees should be adjusted before checking if it's an emergency repayment or not
