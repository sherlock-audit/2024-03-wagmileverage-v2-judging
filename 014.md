# Unchecked Block with Subtraction

## Summary

In the contract LightQuoterV3.sol, the developer is using substraction in an unchecked block in the function _simulateSwap() 

Using subtraction in an unchecked block may silently underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

In modern versions of Solidity, arithmetic operations that would underflow or overflow will now revert by default. However, it is possible to obtain the previous behavior where such operations will wrap rather than reverting, by using an unchecked block. While arithmetic operations inside such blocks may incur lower gas costs, these blocks should be used carefully, as unintended wrapping behavior may lead to program errors if the developer erroneously believes an operation to be safe.

```solidity

            return
                exactInput
                    ? (
                        state.sqrtPriceX96,
                        uint256(amountSpecified - state.amountSpecifiedRemaining),
                        uint256(-state.amountCalculated)
                    )
                    : (
                        state.sqrtPriceX96,
                        uint256(state.amountCalculated),
                        uint256(-(amountSpecified - state.amountSpecifiedRemaining))
                    );
